Null Object Pattern
-------------------
Yosai omits the null object pattern applied in Shiro that is used for cache
management.  There are times when an exception should raise when a None value
is obtained and there are times when None is sufficient.  The decision as to
how to proceed is on a per-case basis.  I do not want implicit guarantees afforded
by the null object pattern so as to minimize boilerplate.  I want the 
system architecture to minimize the boilerplate instead, without "Disabled" 
objects (which use the null object pattern).
