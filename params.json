It is a remarkable system.\r\n\r\nToday, no such open-sourced security framework like Shiro exists for the Python community.  There's an unmet need for one.  Shiro has been battle tested and continues to evolve.  Let's learn from history by porting the java source.  Then, we'll refactor the source using techniques and libraries available in Python and with the expertise from this great development community.\r\n\r\nI am porting the [v2.0-alpha source code](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/shiro/branches/2.0-api-design-changes/)\r\n\r\n\r\nWORD ORIGIN:  Yosai\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIn Japanese, the word Shiro translates to \"Castle\".  Yosai translates to \"Fortress\".  Like the words, the security platforms are similiar in meaning yet not the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT STATUS\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n01/07/2015  I am a one man army who is eager to share the love for this open source project.   Well-seasoned \r\nPython developers who understand best practices in python design and software architecture are urged to consider joining this Project.  I am nearly finished with the rough-rough-rough port to python, leaving much of the source \r\nintact but addressing the lower hanging fruit.  I expect to release this v0.01 baseline to the repository within the next two weeks.\r\n\r\nMy intention for releasing v0.01 is to reveal to the community the effort being made to turn this into reality.  Upon release, the next major phase of development entails reconciling the java with the python.  Business logic inconsistences and any missing pieces will be reviewed and catalogued.\r\n             \r\n             \r\n            \r\nCONTACT INFORMATION\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nIf you would like to get involved, please contact me by the email address in my github profile.  I am often\r\navailable on FreeNode IRC channels #python and #pyramid under the nickname dowwie.\r\n\r\n             \r\n      \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
