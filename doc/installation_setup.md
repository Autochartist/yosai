# Installation and Setup

## Installation
First, install Yosai from PyPi:
    ``pip install yosai``

This will install yosai.core, including its default configuration, and
its dependencies.


## Setup
Currently, Yosai can be configured in two ways:
- using YAML config file, specifying the location of this config file in
  an environment variable, "YOSAI_CORE_SETTINGS"
- using Yosai defaults, specified in a YAML config file located in the
  /config directory of the yosai package
