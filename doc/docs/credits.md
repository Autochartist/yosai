# Respectful Acknowledgement
Yosai would not exist without the hard work of Apache Shiro's authors and its
community.  Yosai, including sections of its documentation, are ported from
Apache Shiro.  

In Japanese, the word Shiro means Castle.  Yosai means fortress.  
Like the names, the projects are similar in meaning, but different.
