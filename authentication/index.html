<h1 id="authentication">Authentication</h1>
<p><img alt="authc" src="../img/authentication.jpg" /></p>
<p>An application bases much of its security on knowing who a user of the system is. Authentication is the process of verifying identity, proving that a subject is who <em>it</em> claims to be.</p>
<h1 id="native-vs-web-yosai-apis">Native vs Web Yosai APIs</h1>
<p>In the examples below, you will see use of the Yosai API, such as <code>@Yosai.requires_user</code>.
You use the <code>Yosai</code> API to secure non-web applications.  When you are working
with web applications, use the <code>WebYosai</code> API instead.</p>
<h1 id="powerful-authentication-using-a-simple-api">Powerful Authentication using a Simple API</h1>
<p>Most of your interactions with Yosai are based on the currently executing user,
called a <strong>Subject</strong>.  You can easily obtain a handle on your subject instance
within the "Yosai context" of your call stack by invoking the <code>Yosai.get_current_subject()</code>
staticmethod.  <code>Yosai.get_current_subject()</code> references a thread-local stack
that is pushed/popped as context is entered and exited:</p>

<h2 id="logging-in-and-logging-out">Logging-In and Logging-Out</h2>
<h2 id="logging-in">Logging-In</h2>
<p>When you <em>log-in</em>, you are attempting to make a secured system recognize your
presence.  The system recognizes who you are by verifying your identity.  Once your
identity is verified, the system considers you present (logged in) by creating a new,
verified session for you.</p>
<p>There are two key processes involved with logging-in:
- Session Management
- Authentication</p>
<h3 id="session-management">Session Management</h3>
<p>Logging-in consists of authentication followed by instantiation of a new session,
removing a guest session that was created for you earlier.</p>
<p>As you first interact with a system secured with Yosai, Yosai recognizes you as
a <em>guest</em>.  A guest is granted an anonymous session (a new one is created) during
the guest's first interaction with the system.  Once authenticated, you are
granted elevated access to the system: your status in the system changes
from when you were anonymous.  The elevation of status involves deleting the anonymous
session and creating a new, <em>verified</em> session for you. Once authenticated, you
are considered present through the existence of this <em>verified</em> session.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-with-example">Authentication, with Example</h3>
<p><em>Authentication</em> is the process of verifying identity.</p>
<p>In the following example, we log-in a Subject by performing password-based
authentication.  This process would raise an AuthenticationException
if it were to fail.  Yosai features a rich exception hierarchy that offers detailed
explanations as to why a login failed. This exception hierarchy helps developers
diagnose bugs or customer service issues related to authentication.</p>
<p>When a developer wishes to authenticate a user using a password-based approach,
the first step requires instantiation of an <code>AuthenticationToken</code> object.  The
<code>UsernamePasswordToken</code> is one such kind of token and is used for password-based
authentication. A <code>UsernamePasswordToken</code> is passed identifying attributes
(username) and credentials (password).</p>

<p>As you can see, authentication entails a single method call: <code>subject.login(authc_token)</code>. The Subject API requires a single method call to authenticate, regardless of the underlying authentication strategy chosen.</p>
<h3 id="cryptographic-hashing-of-passwords">Cryptographic Hashing of Passwords</h3>
<p>For password-based authentication, Yosai uses the Passlib library for cryptographic
hashing and password verification.</p>
<p>The default hashing scheme chosen for Yosai is <em>bcrypt_sha256</em>. As per Passlib
documentation [1], the <em>bcrypt_sha256</em> algorithm works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the password is encoded to UTF-8 if not already encoded.</li>
<li>Then, the UTF-8 encoded password is run through SHA2-256, generating a 32-byte digest</li>
<li>
<p>The 32-byte digest is encoded using base64, resulting in a 44-byte result
  (including the trailing padding '='):
      For the example "password", the output from this stage would be:
        "XohImNooBHFR0OVvjcYpJ3NgPQ1qq73WKhHvch0VQtg=".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the base64 string is passed on to the underlying bcrypt algorithm
  as the new password to be hashed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about Passlib's bcrypt_sha256, you may <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/passlib/lib/passlib.hash.bcrypt_sha256.html#algorithm">access its documentation here</a></p>
<h2 id="logging-out">Logging Out</h2>
<p>When you <em>log-out</em>, the system no longer recognizes your presence nor will it
honor any prior recognition of your identity (you would have to re-authenticate
yourself if you re-engaged the system). When you log-out a user, you are
releasing the identifying state of the user by the application.  A Subject is
logged out when the Subject is done interacting with the application by calling:
<code>subject.logout()</code>, relinquishing all identifying information and
invalidating the user's session.  If you are logging out in a web app,
the RememberMe cookie will also be deleted.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-log-out">Automatic Log Out</h3>
<p>Automatic log out happens at session expiration.  Yosai expires sessions in two
ways: idle timeout and absolute time to live timeout.  Please consult the
Session Management documentation to learn more about timeouts.</p>
<h3 id="manual-log-out">Manual Log Out</h3>
<p>When you manually log-out, you are explicitly telling the system that your work
is done and you do no wish to continue your current session with the system.
Manual log-out is initiated by a user engaging a log-out operation through a user
interface, such as click a "log-out" or "sign out" button, which would ultimately

<h2 id="factors-of-authentication">Factors of Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication methodologies involve three factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>something the user <strong>knows</strong></li>
<li>something the user <strong>has</strong></li>
<li>something the user <strong>is</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Authentication methods that depend on more than one factor, known as multi-factor
authentication (MFA) methods, are considered stronger fraud deterrents than single-factor
 methods as they are more difficult to compromise.  A bank ATM transaction involves
MFA because it requires something the user <strong>has</strong> -- a bank card -- <em>and</em> it
requires something the user <strong>knows</strong> -- a PIN code.</p>
<h2 id="two-factor-authentication">Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
<p>Yosai features native support for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP), the
prevailing standard for one-time password authentication.</p>
<p>Authenticating a user configured for TOTP authentication involves two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Username / Password Authentication</li>
<li>One-time Password Authentication</li>
</ol>
<p>This is considered two-factor authentication because a password represents
something that a person <em>knows</em> and a one-time password represents something
that the user <em>has</em> -- a token generated from a key stored in a secure environment.</p>
<p>Often, service providers offer two-factor authentication like TOTP as an optional
feature rather than force it upon every user.  Yosai follows this approach.
Yosai provides <em>optional 2FA</em> by supporting two methods of authentication:</p>
<ol>
<li>Single factor:  username/password</li>
<li>Two-factor:<ul>
<li>username/password</li>
<li>A two-factor authentication mechanism (TOTP)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-one-time-password-authentication-process-in-yosai">The One-time Password Authentication Process in Yosai</h3>
<p>Authentication always begins with a user first authenticating itself using a username
and password combination.  As to how Yosai responds to a successful username/password
authentication depends on whether the user is configured for two-factor authentication.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-1-single-factor-authentication">Scenario 1:  Single-Factor Authentication</h4>
<p>If a user is configured for single-factor authentication and username/password
is verified, Yosai returns control to the calling application.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-2-two-factor-authentication">Scenario 2:  Two-Factor Authentication</h4>
<p>If a user is configured for two-factor authentication and username/password
is verified, Yosai signals to the calling application to collect 2FA information
from its client by raising an <strong>AdditionalAuthenticationRequired</strong> exception.
Furthermore, Yosai will dispatch an <strong>MFAChallenger</strong>, if one is configured,
to send information to the client.  One such implementation of an
MFAChallenger would be an SMS gateway that messages a client.</p>
<h4 id="two-factor-authentication-sequence">Two-Factor Authentication Sequence</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A client authenticates itself using a username and password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yosai determines whether the user's account is configured for two-factor
authentication.  If the user successfully authenticates step 1 and is configured
for 2FA, Yosai will signal to its caller to collect 2FA information from client
by raising an <strong>AdditionalAuthenticationRequired</strong> exception.  Further, if a <strong>MFAChallenger</strong>
is configured, it is dispatched to coordinate OTP token generation for the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A client obtains a 6-digit OTP token and sends it to the server during OTP authentication.
An OTP token is produced by a hashing algorithm (sha1) that uses as its inputs
a secret key that is unique to a user and an incrementing value (a counter).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yosai obtains from a persisted datastore an encrypted version of the user's
secret key and decrypts it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yosai generates its own one-time password token with the decrypted key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yosai verifies that the server-side generated token matches the token
provided by the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the client and server tokens don't match, Yosai raises an <strong>IncorrectCredentialsException</strong>
to signal that authentication has failed due to an incorrect token provided by
the user.  If tokens match, control is returned to the application calling Yosai.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="account-locking">Account Locking</h2>
<p>Yosai allows developers to regulate account authentication for any particular
user account by defining a number of maximum allowable authentication attempts.
If a developer defines within yosai's authentication settings an <strong>account_lock_threshold</strong>,
account locking is enabled, using <strong>account_lock_threshold</strong> as the limit.</p>
<p>Assuming account locking is enabled, the moment that the number of failed
authentication attempts exceeds the maximum-allowable threshold, Yosai will lock
the account, prohibiting subsequent authentication regardless of whether
credentials match.</p>
<p>An AccountStoreRealm obtains an account from storage.  Prior to authenticating
an account, the realm determines whether account regulation is enabled in
Yosai settings.  If account regulation is enabled, the account's locked
attribute is evaluated to determine whether an account is locked (and if so, when).</p>
<p>If the account is locked:
A <strong>LockedAccountException</strong> is raised, including a tuple containing the timestamp of
the current authentication attempt and a timestamp of when the account was locked.</p>
<p>If the account is not locked, authentication proceeds.</p>
<p>When authentication fails, Yosai caches when the failed attempt happend.  When
the total number of failed attempts exceeds the maximum allowable fails, the
account is locked in the underlying accountstore of the realm that facilitates
locking.  Consequently, failed authentication attempts live in cache until the
corresponding cache entry expires or is deleted.</p>
<h2 id="native-support-for-remember-me-services">Native Support for 'Remember Me' Services</h2>
<p>As shown in the example above, Yosai supports "Remember Me" in addition to
the normal login process.  Yosai makes a very precise distinction between a
remembered Subject and an actual authenticated Subject:</p>
<h3 id="remembered">Remembered</h3>
<p>A remembered Subject is not anonymous and has a known identity (i.e. subject.identifiers is non-empty). However, this identity is remembered from a previous authentication during a previous session. A subject is considered remembered if subject.is_remembered returns True.</p>
<h3 id="authenticated">Authenticated</h3>
<p>An authenticated Subject is one that has been successfully
authenticated (i.e. the login method was called without any exception raised)
during the Subject's current session. A subject is considered authenticated
if subject.authenticated returns True.</p>
<h3 id="mutually-exclusive">Mutually Exclusive</h3>
<p>Remembered and authenticated states are mutually exclusive --  a True value
for one indicates a False value for the other and vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-distinction">Why the Distinction?</h3>
<p>The word 'authentication' has a very strong connotation of proof. That is,
there is an expected guarantee that the Subject has proven that it is who it
claims to be.</p>
<p>When a user is merely remembered by a previous interaction with the application,
the state of proof no longer exists.  The remembered identity gives the system
an idea who that user <em>probably</em> is, yet the system has no guarantees that the remembered Subject represents an expected user. Once the subject is authenticated, the user is no longer considered only remembered because its identity would have been verified during the current session.</p>
<p>So although many parts of the application can still perform user-specific logic
based on the remembered identifiers, such as customized views, it should
typically never perform highly-sensitive operations until the user has
legitimately verified its identity by executing a successful authentication
attempt.</p>
<p>For example, a check whether a Subject can access financial information should
almost always depend on subject.authenticated rather than subject.is_remembered to guarantee an expected and verified identity.</p>
<h3 id="remember-me-example">Remember-Me Example</h3>
<p>The following is a fairly common scenario that helps illustrate why the the
distinction between remembered and authenticated is important.</p>
<p>Let's say you're using Amazon.com. You've logged-in successfully and have added
a few books to your shopping cart. But you have to run off to a meeting, but
forget to log out. By the time the meeting is over, it's time to go home and
you leave the office.</p>
<p>The next day when you come in to work, you realize you didn't complete your
purchase, so you go back to amazon.com. This time, Amazon 'remembers' who you
are, greets you by name, and still gives you some personalized book
recommendations. To Amazon, subject.is_remembered would return True.</p>
<p>But, what happens if you try to access your account to update your credit card
information to make your book purchase? While Amazon 'remembers' you
(is_remembered is True), it cannot guarantee that you are in fact you (for
example, maybe a co-worker is using your computer).</p>
<p>So before you can perform a sensitive action like updating credit card
information, Amazon will force you to login so that they can guarantee your
identity. After you login, your identity has been verified and to Amazon,
subject.authenticated would now be True.</p>
<p>This scenario happens so frequently for many types of applications, so the
functionality is built in to Yosai so that you may leverage it for your own
application. Now, whether you use subject.is_remembered or subject.authenticated to customize your views and workflows is up to you, but Yosai will maintain this
fundamental state in case you need it.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-events">Authentication Events</h2>
<p>An Event is emitted to the singleton EventBus when the results of
authentication are obtained, indicating whether authentication succeeded or
failed (without compromising credentials).  If you would like to learn more
about Event processing, please refer to the documentation about Event
Processing.</p>
<p>Events are communicated using a publish-subscribe paradigm.  In the case of
Authentication, the <code>DefaultAuthenticator</code> publishes an event to a channel (an
internal Event Bus). The EventBus relays an event to consumers who have
subscribed to the event's topic. It relays the event by calling the callback
method registered for a consumer, using the event payload as its argument(s).</p>
<p>The following table lists the Authentication-related events and subscriber(s):</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>Event Topic</th>
