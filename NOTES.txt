within /subject/support:
    note sure how to port SubjectRunnable, SubjectCallable, SubjectThreadState

there are several methods that make local copies of a mutable parameter and
I think I haven't accounted for their mutability by making a copy.copy of 
them

replace 'Input' docstrings with real syntax:
        :param arg1: the first value
        :type arg1: int, float,...
        :param arg2: the first value
        :type arg2: int, float,...
        :param arg3: the first value
        :type arg3: int, float,...
        :returns: arg1/arg2 +arg3
        :rtype: int, float

move towards duck-typing and away from type checking

for each module, create corresponding interfaces.py and abstracts.py module

  `--- authc.py
       interfaces.py
