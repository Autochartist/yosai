there are several methods that make local copies of a mutable parameter and
I think I haven't accounted for their mutability by making a copy.copy of 
them

       abstracts.py

It's not yet clear how/where the cacheManager is used by the DefaultAccountCacheHandler.
The cacheManager is inherited from the AbstractCacheHandler.
I get the impression that this is either a relic of legacy pre-2.0 code or
unfinished work for Shiro 2.0, perhaps related to the resolvers?

Anywhere shiro performs an "instanceof" check on an object before performing an operation,
it's checking whether that object implements an interface.  Not sure whether t
LBYL or EAFP in these circumstances..

Shiro uses a LinkedHashSet to preserve order

not yet clear as to whether I need to be as concerned about hash codes as Shiro is..(sessions?)

general rule is to use no more than 1 level of inheritance
