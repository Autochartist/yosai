Interfaces have been defined in the Shiro 2.0 alpha yet have no
corresponding concrete class implementation using them.  I presume this is 
due to their discretionary nature and that their implementation is subject
to change among the datastores used.

Requiring Concrete Implementations:
   - Account
   - AccountStore
   - AuthorizingAccountStoreRealm
   - AccountCacheResolver
   - AccountCacheKeyResolver
   - CacheManager

Porting annotations to python decorators

Serializables:  any serializable class in shiro should have its respective
                serializable counterpart in Yosai, common sense permitting

refactoring shiro thread-based concurrency to an appropriate concurrency 
solution in python  (greenlets?  asyncio coroutines?)

add eventbus functionality to the ModularRealmAuthorizor, and inject the 
eventbus from the DefaultSecurityManager into the MRA
