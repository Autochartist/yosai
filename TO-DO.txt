Interfaces have been defined in the Shiro 2.0 alpha yet have no
corresponding concrete class implementation using them.  I presume this is 
due to their discretionary nature and that their implementation is subject
to change among the datastores used.

Requiring Concrete Implementations:
   - Account
   - AccountStore
   - AuthorizingAccountStoreRealm
   - AccountCacheResolver
   - AccountCacheKeyResolver
   - CacheManager

Porting annotations to python decorators

Serialization:  __getstate__ is __serialize__, and the serialization needs to be 
                completed

/serialize sub-package changed to accomodate marshmallow, so unit tests 
changes are required
