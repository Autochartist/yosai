The following interfaces have been defined in the Shiro 2.0 alpha yet have no
corresponding concrete class implementation using them.  I presume this is 
due to their discretionary nature and that their implementation is subject
to change among the datastores used.

Required:
   - Account
   - AccountStore
   - AccountCacheResolver
   - AccountCacheKeyResolver
