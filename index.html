<p>Please, first familiarize yourself with <a href="http://shiro.apache.org/">Apache Shiro</a>.  It is a remarkable system.</p>

<p>Today, no such open-sourced security framework like Shiro exists for the Python community.  There's an unmet need for one.  Shiro has been battle tested and continues to evolve.  Let's learn from history by porting the java source.  Then, we'll refactor the source using techniques and libraries available in Python and with the expertise from this great development community.</p>

<p>I am porting the <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/shiro/branches/2.0-api-design-changes/">v2.0-alpha source code</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="word-origin--yosai" class="anchor" href="#word-origin--yosai" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>WORD ORIGIN:  Yosai</h2>

<p>In Japanese, the word Shiro translates to "Castle".  Yosai translates to "Fortress".  Like the words, the security platforms are similiar in meaning yet not the same.</p>

<p>01/07/2015  I am a one man army who is eager to share the love for this open source project.   Well-seasoned 
Python developers who understand best practices in python design and software architecture are urged to consider joining this Project.  I am nearly finished with the rough-rough-rough port to python, leaving much of the source 
intact but addressing the lower hanging fruit.  I expect to release this v0.01 baseline to the repository within the next two weeks.</p>

<p>My intention for releasing v0.01 is to reveal to the community the effort being made to turn this into reality.  Upon release, the next major phase of development entails reconciling the java with the python.  Business logic inconsistences and any missing pieces will be reviewed and catalogued.</p>
